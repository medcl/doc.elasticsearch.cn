p. When doing things like facet navigation, sometimes only the hits are needed to be filtered by the chosen facet, and all the facets should continue to be calculated based on the original query. The @filter@ element within the search request can be used to accomplish it.

Facets provide aggregated data . In the simplest case, a terms facet can return facet counts for various facet values for a specific field. ElasticSearch supports more facet implementations, such as statistical or date histogram facets.  有时只是hits需要被选中的facet过滤， all the facets 仍在原查询的基础上进行， The @filter@ 用于此场景。

p. Note, this is different compared to creating a **@filtered@ query** with **the filter**, since this will cause %{color:red}the facets to only process the filtered results%.

p. For example, lets create two tweets, with two different tags:

<pre class="prettyprint">
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1' -d '
{
    "message" : "something blue",
    "tag" : "blue"
}
'

curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/2' -d '
{
    "message" : "something green",
    "tag" : "green"
}
'

curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_refresh'
</pre>

p. We can now search for something, and have a terms facet.

<pre class="prettyprint">
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/twitter/_search?pretty=true' -d '
{
    "query" : {
        "term" : { "message" : "something" }
    },
    "facets" : {
        "tag" : {
            "terms" : { "field" : "tag" }
        }
    }
}
'
</pre>

p. We get two hits, and the relevant facets with a count of 1 for both @green@ and @blue@. 

p. *Now, lets say the @green@ facet is chosen, we can simply add a filter for it:*

<pre class="prettyprint">
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/twitter/_search?pretty=true' -d '
{
    "query" : {
        "term" : { "message" : "something" }
    },
    "filter" : {
        "term" : { "tag" : "green" }
    },
    "facets" : {
        "tag" : {
            "terms" : { "field" : "tag" }
        }
    }
}
'
</pre>

p. And now, we get only 1 hit back, but the facets remain the same.

p. Note, if additional filters is required on specific facets, they can be added as a @facet_filter@ to the relevant facets.
